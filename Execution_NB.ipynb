By reading and running an Execution notebook, the user should know what data is used as an input, what the tool does, what the output data looks like, and have the code necessary to run the tool on their own data. The Execution Notebook should also have two included directories, one for source, environment information and utility functions, and one for containing input and output data. The end product should be both functional as a notebook based interface for using the tool and well educational and allow for the user to understand what the tool is doing. \n",
